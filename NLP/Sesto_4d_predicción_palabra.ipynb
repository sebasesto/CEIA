Oh, killjoy I hear you, come on, get up you say Time to start another day Even he orders me around Well, there\\'s one thing They can\\'t order me to stop dreaming And perhaps someday The dreams that I wish will come true No matter how your heart is grieving If you keep on believing The dream that you wish will come true I\\'ve been staring at the edge of the water Long as I can remember Never really knowing why I wish I could be the perfect daughter But I come back to the water No matter how hard I try Every turn I take Every trail I track Every path I make Every road leads back to the place I know Where I cannot go Where I long to be See the line where the sky meets the sea It calls me And no one knows how far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me One day I\\'ll know If I go there\\'s just no telling how far I\\'ll go I know everybody on this island Seems so happy on this island Everything is by design I know everybody on this island Has a role on this island So maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride I can make us strong I\\'ll be satisfied if I play along But the voice inside sings a different song What is wrong with me See the light as it shines on the sea It\\'s blinding But no one knows how deep it goes And it seems like it\\'s calling out to me So come find me And let me know What\\'s beyond that line Will I cross that line The line where the sky meets the sea It calls me And no one knows how far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me One day I\\'ll know How far I\\'ll go Look at me I will never pass for a perfect bride Or a perfect daughter Can it be I\\'m not meant to play this part? Now I see That if I were truly to be myself I would break my fam\\'ly\\'s heart Who is that girl I see Staring straight Back at me? Why is my reflection someone I don\\'t know? Somehow I cannot hide Who I am Though I\\'ve tried When will my reflection show Who I am inside? When will my reflection show Who I am inside? When you wish upon a star Makes no difference who you are Anything your heart desires Will come to you If your heart is in your dream No request is too extreme When you wish upon a star As dreamers do Fate is kind She brings to those to love The sweet fulfillment of Their secret longing Like a bolt out of the blue Fate steps in and sees you through When you wish upon a star Your dreams come true Belle: There\\'s something sweet and almost kind But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined And now he\\'s dear and so unsure I wonder why I didn\\'t see it there before Beast: She glanced this way, I thought I saw And when we touched she didn\\'t shudder at my paw No it can\\'t be, I\\'ll just ignore But then she\\'s never looked at me that way before Belle: New and a bit alarming Who\\'d have ever thought that this could be?

All three: We\\'ll wait and see A few days more There may be something there that wasn\\'t there before Cogsworth: Well here\\'s a thought, perhaps there\\'s something there that wasn\\'t there before Chip: What mama? Mrs Potts: There may be something there that wasn\\'t there before If there\\'s a prize for rotten judgment I guess I\\'ve already won that No man is worth the aggravation That\\'s ancient history, been there, done that Who d\\'you think you\\'re kidding He\\'s the earth and heaven to you Try to keep it hidden Honey we can see right through you (Oh no) Girl, you can\\'t conceal it We know how you\\'re feeling Who you thinking of?

[Moana:] Who am I? I am a girl who loves my island I\\'m the girl who loves the sea It calls me I am the daughter of the village chief We are descended from voyagers Who found their way across the world They call me I\\'ve delivered us to where we are I have journeyed farther I am everything I\\'ve learned and more Still it calls me And the call isn\\'t out there at all, it\\'s inside me It\\'s like the tide; always falling and rising I will carry you here in my heart you\\'ll remind me That come what may I know the way I am Moana! The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself Can you do that? My dear, sweet child, that\\'s what I do It\\'s what I live for To help unfortunate merfolk like yourself Poor souls with no one else to turn to I admit that in the past I\\'ve been a nasty They weren\\'t kidding when they called me, well, a witch But you\\'ll find that nowadays I\\'ve mended all my ways Repented, seen the light, and made a switch To this And I fortunately know a little magic It\\'s a talent that I always have possessed And dear lady, please don\\'t laugh I use it on behalf Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed (Pathetic) Poor unfortunate souls In pain, in need This one longing to be thinner That one wants to get the girl And do I help them? Yes, indeed Those poor unfortunate souls So sad, so true They come flocking to my cauldron Crying, \"Spells, Ursula, please!\" And I help them Yes I do Now it\\'s happened once or twice Someone couldn\\'t pay the price And I\\'m afraid I had to rake \\'em \\'cross the coals Yes I\\'ve had the odd complaint But on the whole I\\'ve been a saint To those poor unfortunate souls Have we got a deal? If I become human, I\\'ll never be with my father or sisters again But you\\'ll have your man Life\\'s full of tough choices, isn\\'t it? Oh, and there is one more thing We haven\\'t discussed the subject of payment But I don\\'t have- I\\'m not asking much, just a token really, a trifle What I want from you is your voice But without my voice, how can I- You\\'ll have your looks, your pretty face And don\\'t underestimate the importance of body language, ha! The men up there don\\'t like a lot of blabber They think a girl who gossips is a bore Yet on land it\\'s much preferred for ladies not to say a word And after all dear, what is idle babble for? Come on, they\\'re not all that impressed with conversation True gentlemen avoid it when they can But they dote and swoon and fawn On a lady who\\'s withdrawn It\\'s she who holds her tongue who gets a man Come on you poor unfortunate soul Go ahead Make your choice I\\'m a very busy woman and I haven\\'t got all day It won\\'t cost much Just your voice! You poor unfortunate soul It\\'s sad but true If you want to cross the bridge, my sweet You\\'ve got the pay the toll Take a gulp and take a breath And go ahead and sign the scroll Flotsam, Jetsam, now I\\'ve got her, boys The boss is on a roll This poor unfortunate soul Beluga sevruga Come winds of the Caspian Sea Larengix glaucitis Et max laryngitis La voce to me Now, sing Aa-aa-aah, a-aa-aah Keep singing!

The seas be ours, and by the powers; where we will; we\\'ll roam. So many times out there I\\'ve watched a happy pair of lovers walking in the night They had a kind of glow around them It almost looked like heaven\\'s light I knew I\\'d never know that warm and loving glow Though I might wish with all my might No face as hideous as my face Was ever meant for heaven\\'s light But suddenly an angel has smiled at me And kissed my cheek without a trace of fright I dare to dream that she might even care for me And as I ring these bells tonight My cold dark tower seems so bright I swear it must be Heaven\\'s light Confiteor deo omnipotenti (I confess to God almighty) Beatae Mariae semper virgini (To blessed Mary ever virgin) Beato Michaeli archangelo (To the blessed Archangel Michael) Sanctis apostolis omnibus sanctis (To the Holy Apostles, to all the saints) Beata Maria, you know I am a righteous man Of my virtue I am justly proud Et tibit Pater (And to you, Father) Beata Maria, you know I\\'m so much purer than The common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd Quia peccavi nimis (That I have sinned) Then tell me, Maria, why I see her dancing there?

Morning in Paris, the city awakes To the bells of Notre Dame The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes To the bells of Notre Dame To the big bells as loud as the thunder To the little bells soft as a psalm And some say the soul of the city is The toll of the bells The bells of Notre Dame Dark was the night when our tale was begun On the docks near Notre Dame Four frightened gypsies slid silently under The docks near Notre Dame But a trap had been laid for the gypsies And they gazed up in fear and alarm At a figure whose clutches Were iron as much as the bells The bells of Notre Dame (Kyrie Eleison) Judge Claude Frollo longed To purge the world Of vice and sin (Kyrie Eleison) And he saw corruption Ev\\'rywhere Except within Dies irae, dies illa (Dies irae, dies illa) Dies irae, dies illa (Dies irae, dies illa) Solvet saeclum in favilla Teste David cum sibylla Quantus tremor est futurus Quando Judex est venturus See there the innocent blood you have spilt On the steps of Notre Dame Now you would add this child\\'s blood to your guilt On the steps of Notre Dame You can lie to yourself and your minions You can claim that you haven\\'t a qualm But you never can run from Nor hide what you\\'ve done from the eyes The very eyes of Notre Dame (Kyrie Eleison) And for one time in his live Of power and control (Kyrie Eleison) Frollo felt a twinge of fear For his immortal soul Just so he\\'s kept locked away Where no one else can see Even this foul creature may Yet prove one day to be Of use to me Now here is a riddle to guess if you can Sing the bells of Notre Dame Who is the monster and who is the man Sing the bells, bells, bells, bells Bells, bells, bells, bells Bells of Notre Dame I can show you the world Shining, shimmering, splendid Tell me, princess, now when did You last let your heart decide? I can open your eyes Take you wonder by wonder Over, sideways and under On a magic carpet ride A whole new world A new fantastic point of view No one to tell us no or where to go Or say we\\'re only dreaming A whole new world A dazzling place I never knew But when I\\'m way up here, it\\'s crystal clear That now I\\'m in a whole new world with you Now I\\'m in a whole new world with you Unbelievable sights Indescribable feeling Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling Through an endless diamond sky A whole new world Don\\'t you dare close your eyes A hundred thousand things to see (Hold your breath, it gets better) I\\'m like a shooting star I\\'ve come so far I can\\'t go back To where I used to be A whole new world Every turn a surprise With new horizons to pursue Every moment red-letter I\\'ll chase them anywhere There\\'s time to spare Let me share this whole new world with you A whole new world That\\'s where we\\'ll be A thrilling chase A wondrous place For you and me Somewhere out there, Beneath the pale moonlight, Someone\\'s thinking of me, And loving me tonight. Somewhere out there, Someone\\'s saying a prayer, That we\\'ll find one another, In that big somewhere out there. And even though I know how very far apart we are, It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star, And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby, It helps to think we\\'re sleeping underneath the same big sky! Somewhere out there, If love can see us through, Then we\\'ll be together, Somewhere out there, Out where dreams Come true...

For a handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls And never dreams that something might be coming? Just around the river bend Just around the river bend I look once more just around the river bend Beyond the shore somewhere past the sea Don\\'t know what for why do all my dreams extend Just around the river bend, just around the river bend Should I choose the smoothest course Steady as the beating drum? Should I marry Kocoum? Is all my dreaming at an end? Or do you still wait for me, dream giver Just around the river bend?

Hakuna Matata Hakuna Matata Hakuna Matata Hakuna It means no worries For the rest of your days It\\'s our problem-free philosophy Hakuna Matata From the day we arrive on the planet And blinking, step into the sun There\\'s more to see than can ever be seen More to do than can ever be done There\\'s far too much to take in here More to find than can ever be found But the sun rolling high Through the sapphire sky Keeps great and small on the endless round It\\'s the circle of life And it moves us all Through despair and hope Through faith and love Till we find our place On the path unwinding In the circle The circle of life It\\'s the circle of life And it moves us all Through despair and hope Through faith and love Till we find our place On the path unwinding In the circle The circle of life Mmmmmm Mmmmmm So this is love Mmmmmm So this is love So this is what makes life divine I\\'m all aglow, mmmmmm And now I know And now I know The key to all heaven is mine My heart has wings, mmmmmm And I can fly I\\'ll touch every star in the sky So this is the miracle That I\\'ve been dreaming of Mmmmmm Mmmmmm So this is love Oh, this is the night, it\\'s a beautiful night And we call it bella notte Look at the skies, they have stars in their eyes On this lovely bella notte Side by side with your loved one You\\'ll find enchantment here The night will weave its magic spell When the one you love is near For this is the night, and the heavens are right On this lovely bella notte This is the night, it\\'s a beautiful night And we call it bella notte Look at the skies, they have stars in their eyes On this lovely bella notte Side by side with your loved one You\\'ll find enchantment here The night will weave its magic spell When the one you love is near For this is the night, and the heavens are right On this lovely bella notte Look at me, I will never pass for a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter. Can it be, I\\'m not meant to play this part? Now I see, that if I were truly to be myself, I would break my family\\'s heart. Who is that girl I see, staring straight back at me? Why is my reflection someone I don\\'t know? Somehow I cannot hide Who I am, though I\\'ve tried. When will my reflection show, who I am, inside? How I pray, that a time will come, I can free myself, from their expectations On that day, I\\'ll discover someway to be myself, and to make my family proud. They want a docile lamb, No-one knows who I am. Must there be a secret me, I\\'m forced to hide? Must I pretend that I am someone else for all time? When will my reflection show, who I am inside? When will my reflection show, who I am inside? I know you I walked with you Once Upon a dream I know you That gleam in your eyes Is so familiar a gleam Yet I know it\\'s true That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you I know what you do You\\'ll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream La da la da la ahahahahah But if I know you I know what you do You\\'ll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream I know you I walked with you Once Upon a dream I know you That gleam in your eyes Is so familiar a gleam Yet I know it\\'s true That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you I know what you do You\\'ll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream There\\'s a calm surrender to the rush of day When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away An enchanted moment and it sees me through It\\'s enough for this restless warrior just to be with you And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are It\\'s enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far And can you feel the love tonight? How it\\'s laid to rest It\\'s enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best There\\'s a time for everyone, if they only learn That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn There\\'s a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are It\\'s enough for this wide-eyed wanderer that we got this far And can you feel the love tonight? How it\\'s laid to rest It\\'s enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best It\\'s enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best Ou mata e matagi Ou loto mamaina toa Manatu atu Taku pelepele Pa mai to mafanafanaga Saolotoga tenei Manatunatu Ki tamafine Maua ai te lumanai Ki tamafine Ou mata e matagi Ke manatua Faiga iena te luelue te malohi ina hiva Ke manatua Faiga iena te fiafia te malie ina hiva Hau la ke ta o kuku mai to lima Hau la ke ta o hau ta hihiva Hau la ke ta o kuku mai to lima Hau la ke ta o ko koe taku pele e fofou ai au Tamilomilo fakatamilomilo e kua ninimo toku ulu Tamilomilo fakatamilomilo toe fai toe fai ke manino Katakata mai hihiva mai fakalogo ki te pate aue ma te luelue Translation: Do you remember when we did all that the sway the energy expressed in the dance Do you remember when we did all that the joy and sweetness expressed in the dance come on let\\'s go give me your hand come on let\\'s go come let\\'s dance come on let\\'s go give me your hand come on let\\'s go you are the only one that I wish for Round and round spinning round hey my head\\'s getting dizzy Round and round spinning round do it again it\\'ll soon clear Smile my way keep on dancing listen to the pate and keep on swaying Chief Tui: Moana, make way, make way!

this is where I\\'m meant to be I\\'ll be there someday, I can go the distance I will find my way if I can be strong I know every mile would be worth my while When I go the distance, I\\'ll be right where I belong Down an unknown road to embrace my fate Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you And a thousand years would be worth the wait It might take a lifetime but somehow I\\'ll see it through And I won\\'t look back, I can go the distance And I\\'ll stay on track, no I won\\'t accept defeat It\\'s an uphill slope But I won\\'t loose hope, \\'till I go the distance And my journey is complete, oh yeah But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part For a hero\\'s strength is measured by his heart, oh Like a shooting star, I will go the distance I will search the world, I will face its harms I don\\'t care how far, I can go the distance \\'Till I find my hero\\'s welcome waiting in your arms I will search the world, I will face its harms \\'Till I find my hero\\'s welcome waiting in your arms I\\'ve got no strings To hold me down To make me fret Or make me frown I had strings But now I\\'m free There are no strings on me Hi-ho the me-ri-o That\\'s the only way to go I

entre nous I\\'d cut my strings for you Down where the Volga flows There\\'s a Russian rendezvous Where me and Ivan go But I\\'d rather go with you, hey There are no strings on me Come stop your crying It will be alright Just take my hand And hold it tight I will protect you From all around you I will be here Don\\'t you cry For one so small, You seem so strong My arms will hold you, Keep you safe and warm This bond between us Can\\'t be broken I will be here Don\\'t you cry \\'Cause you\\'ll be in my heart Yes, you\\'ll be in my heart From this day on Now and forever more You\\'ll be in my heart No matter what they say You\\'ll be here in my heart Always Why can\\'t they understand the way we feel They just don\\'t trust what they can\\'t explain I know we\\'re different, but deep inside us We\\'re not that different at all And you\\'ll be in my heart Yes you\\'ll be in my heart From this day on Now and forever more Don\\'t listen to them \\'Cause what do they know We need each other, to have, to hold They\\'ll see in time, I know When destiny calls you, you must be strong I may not be with you But you got to hold on They\\'ll see in time, I know We\\'ll show them together \\'Cause you\\'ll be in my heart Believe me you\\'ll be in my heart I\\'ll be there from this day on Now and forever more You\\'ll be in my heart No matter what they say You\\'ll be here in my heart
