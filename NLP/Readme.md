## Challenge N°1: Word2vec
This challenge consists in to learn the basic concepts of NLP, we implement by hand the conversion of sentences to vectors using **OneHotEncoding**, after we using **Frequency Vectors**, and finally **TFIDF**.

## Challenge N°2: Rule based bot using DNN + spaCy
In this challenge, we put into practice the preprocessing in NLP with **tokenization**, **steeming**, and **lemmatization**. To do this, we used the libraries **NLTK** and **SpaCY**.

## Challenge N°3: Custom embeddings using Gensim
In this challenge we **training of custom embeddings** using the library **Gensim** to analyze the lyrics of songs written.

## Challenge N°4: Word prediction using RNN
In this challenge, we learn the concept of a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**. We implement many_to_one architecture for doing **word prediction**.

## Challenge N°5: Reviews classification using LSTM
In this challenge, we learn the concept of a **Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)** and the **FastText** library which provide **pretrained embeddings**. We tested it by developing classifier reviews of clothing ecommerce.

## Challenge N°6: Q&A bot using Seq2Seq
In this challenge, we build a **conversational bot** with **encoder-decoder seq2seq** architecture. The user can ask some questions and the bot will answer. To stop the interaction with the bot send an empty string.
